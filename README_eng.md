# Library of Machine Learning Methods for Processing and Generating Vector Graphics

This library contains methods for generative processing of vector graphics.

The library includes the following methods:

## EvoVec - an evolutionary method for optimal vectorization of images.

## Plagiarism detection of drawings based on a recursive transformer with memory.

## VectorNST - a modern iterative method for style transfer in vector graphics.

## CoverGAN - a generator of vector music album covers based on a user's track and its emotion.

## VectorWeaver - an unconditional generator of vector images based on a two-stage transformer.
